# discord-bot
Discord bot made for a private Discord server.

The purpose of the Discord bot is to provide extra utility to our Discord server by providing a range of commands that are relevant to it. 

Please bear in mind that it is made specifically for that server, so it is most likely not transferable to another project.

The bot is currently running on a private VPS, hence the docker-compose file.
